- 👋 Hi, I’m @sshukwit
- 👀 I’m interested in downloading 70's to currnet pinball games onto my ultimate legends gamer pro
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that it is hard to find the pinball machines such as Cyclone to be able to play on this machine
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting pinball machines for the above metioned device. I wanted to purchase a real machine with the virtual tables
 installed but my living space is only 705 SQ ft so therfore I went with the small legends gamer pro with the pinball buttons plus the stand! Just bought
 the hardware thinking it would be easy to get the games.... Not - 
- 📫 How to reach me - e-mail
